Let me check the available tools. There's a calculate function that can subtract. The parameters required are operation, x, and y. The operation should be \"subtract\", and the two numbers are x and y. Wait, but in the question, 123 is being subtracted by 456. So which one is x and which is y? The function's parameters are x and y, but the order matters. If the operation is subtract, it's x minus y. So the user wrote 123 - 456, which would be x=123 and y=456. But I should make sure that the function is called correctly. Let me confirm: the function's description says \"Perform basic arithmetic operations\" with subtract as an option. So the correct way is to pass operation as \"subtract\", x as 123, and y as 456. That should give the right result. Alright, I'll structure the tool call accordingly.\n"
